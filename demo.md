Here is a chart showing how Plover maps your regular QWERTY keyboard into the steno layout:

![Qwerty to steno chart, where AWSEDRF CV PM UJIKOLP;\[' correspond to steno's STKPWHR AO EU FRPBLGTSDZ]({{ "/images/qwerty_to_steno.png" | relative_url }})
{: #qwerty_chart}

Click in the **Output** box below to begin. Write your first sentence:

- In QWERTY: `av a wr dvl ru`
- In steno: `SO S- TH- WOG H-F`
- In English: `so is this working?`

Remember: **hit all the keys in a word at once, then release them together**.

*Warning: the demo is not responsive and is best experienced on a computer with a keyboard attached in a large browser window.*
