The Open Steno Project is run by volunteers.

The **best way to contribute is by being a member of the community**. Help by giving us feedback as you learn and using your unique talents to help out Open Steno as a whole.

See our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover#contributing) on Plover's GitHub.

We also accept donations, which are used to help fund new projects and pay maintenance costs (website and software deployment fees).
